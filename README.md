# MeinKraft


Yes, I do know that "force" or "power" is "die Kraft" in German, so the correct form would be "MeineKraft". :) 

I'm trying to implement some features of Minecraft in this project. The code is written in Python and it uses the pyglet framework and the PyOpenGL graphics library. I want the game to be be more mod-friendly, realistic and  than Minecraft in some regards. For example, there should be no tree punching any more, no diamond finding, etc.

It's based on fogleman's code: (also check out Konstructs, another game by him, forked by others)

## How to run the program for the time being (there will be an installer in the future)

* Install Python 3, Python 2 won't do 
* Install pyglet
*    run this command from the command line: pip install pyglet
* Install Git
*  Just google for it :)
* type these commands:
*    git clone https://bitbucket.org/Pannoniae/meinkraft
*    cd meinkraft
*    python main.py

## Changes from the original

I realized that this project became a lot more than a fork of the original 500-line code. So basically this is a Minecraft pre-alpha.


## How to Play

Standard Minecraft controls.
