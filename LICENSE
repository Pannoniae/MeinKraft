Hi. Instead of creating of a copyright licence, I'm making a disclaimer. This product is fully open-source, use licenses
as you see fit. I'm trusting you to act nice and don't claim my work, but surely, nothing can prevent it, so I give you
freedom in this subject. I hate GPL, LGPL and the other kinds of 'distribute under the same licence' stuff, so I don't
think that I should do it for this project. If I would make this project closed-source, or send-src-on-request-but-not-
for-everyone, and I would find a GPL library, I won't obey anything that it restricts. I'm in good faith belief that
this approachment makes developers writing code twice. In an ideal world without fucking licences, and if lib is good
 enough, everybody wouldn't write same code twice, instead will use libraries for everything. But now, developers are
 forced to write redundant code, because idiotic licences are here. If you really want to steal my work, you can. Yes,
 there are GPL protection lawyers, but with obfuscating enough, theoretically you can use them. As I said in the begin-
 ning, I insist on your moral beliefs to not do wrong things, but I would surely approve even if you earn millions of
 dollars of it and don't give me credit. Yes, I know if I would enforce licence I would get fame in this case, but:
 1. you can circumvent this, 2. maybe I don't deserve it 3. I would slowing your advance and stealing money from you by
 not letting you sell YOUR product. With these principles, I will do the same. Attribute will be given, but I don't
 fucking care about licence stuff. I don't want to earn money with this mostly, this project is just for fun. I don't
 care about piracy and that, even I happily send your my product if it becomes payware, and if you're a modder the sour-
 ce code; I trust you all, the 7 billion children of the world.
