Hi. Instead of creating of a copyright licence, I'm making a disclaimer. This product is fully open-source, use licenses
as you see fit. I'm trusting you to act nice and don't claim my work, but surely, nothing can prevent it, so I give you
freedom in this subject. I hate GPL, LGPL and the other kinds of 'distribute under the same licence' stuff, so I don't
think that I should do it for this project.
