 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim or modified
 copies of this license document, and changing it is allowed as my name is put on it.

 It should be noted that I used code from fogleman's 'Minecraft' who hasn't put a license on his work yet, so safely
 assumed that he allows me to use this license. The code isn't separated, basically this is a derivation on a render-
 ing engine.
